ABB will be supplying GIS for the construction of a transmission grid that will help to strengthen the infrastructure in order to gradually integrate electricity generated by more renewable sources. Renewable energy is difficult to predict and causes load fluctuations. Its integration into the power grid requires a strong and resilient transmission infrastructure. The network connects wind power generators in eastern Austria to pumped storage power plants in the western part of the country. It will also transport surplus solar and wind power to pumped storage power plants in the Alps that act as \"green batteries\" for storing electricity that can be harvested during high demand periods. Under the #mission 2030 plan, Austria targets to achieve 100% electricity consumption from renewable energy and a fully carbon-free society by 2030. This goal also honors the European Union's renewable energy targets. From end 2019 to 2024, ABB's GIS will be installed in various substations around the country. GIS is a compact, metal-encapsulated switchgear that uses pressurized insulating gas, enabling safe operations in confined spaces. It significantly reduces equipment footprint by occupying only 10% of the space taken by an air-insulated switchgear substation, thus acting as an important enabler for urbanization.\n",
